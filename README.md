#Mental Health Match
My final project for the Arkansas Coding Academy is an application to help primary care physicians and mental health professionals connect in a meaningful way so patients can be guided to the correct service and/or provider type from the onset of treatment.  

#Provider Search
The provider search page allows a provider to search for mental health professionals based on set criteria returning the best match for the provider.


#New Provider
The new provider information page allows the provider to input their information into the database.
