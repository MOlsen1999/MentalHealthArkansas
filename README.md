#Mental Health Match
I have developed the Mental Health Match as my wife is a local psychiatrist, 
and she has talked many times about how AR consistently ranks one of the worst states for access to mental health services, 
yet she is often tied up seeing referrals that would have been better directed elsewhere.  This project aims to help primary care physicians and mental health professionals connect in a meaningful way to guide potential patients to the best-fitting clinician from the onset of treatment. 
My application has a page for providers to input their demographics and preferred patient population as well as their treatment areas of expertise, building an ever expanding database of mental health providers in the state. 
This information is then searchable by registered PCP’s and other clinicians to input their patient’s data to find the best fitting psychiatrist, therapist, or psychological examiner for their patient’s specific needs, therefore eliminating unnecessary appointments to find the precise type of care needed.  
My future plans for the project include a trial run for internal use at my wife’s place of employment, then hopefully I can present this to some of the local medical societies for backing and proceed with a full launch of the product.
